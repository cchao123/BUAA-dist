It facilitates the exchange of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF), promoting the removal of metabolic by-products such as amyloid-β and tau from brain tissue. This discovery has revolutionized our understanding of brain homeostasis, sleep physiology, and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Research progress has been remarkable. Advanced imaging techniques, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and two-photon microscopy, have visualized glymphatic flow in real time. Studies have linked impaired glymphatic function to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and small-vessel cerebrovascular disease. Novel animal and human data also suggest that sleep quality, vascular pulsatility, and aquaporin-4 polarization at astrocytic end-feet are critical determinants of glymphatic efficiency. Looking ahead, the field is moving toward translational applications — Developing noninvasive biomarkers and imaging methods to assess glymphatic function in patients. Exploring therapeutic interventions — from optimizing sleep and vascular health to pharmacologic modulation of aquaporin-4 — to enhance waste clearance. Building cross-disciplinary collaborations linking neuroscience, vascular biology, and bioengineering to translate basic discoveries into clinical impact.<br /><br />Brain Glymphatics and Meningeal Lymphatics Symposium 2026 brings together leading researchers and clinicians to share the latest findings, forge new partnerships, and chart the next decade of innovation in this exciting field.
